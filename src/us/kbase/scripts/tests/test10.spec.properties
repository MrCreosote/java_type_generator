/*
KBase File Type Manager Service

This service tracks the type of files that KBase software recognizes and
properties of these file types (such as acceptable file extensions).  File types
exist in a hierarchy (e.g. XML is a type of TEXT file) and are uniquely identified
by a short unique string id.  File types are loosely coupled to different types
of data supported by KBase.

In the future, this service may provide some validation capabilities to ensure
that a given file matches some basic properties of  file type, e.g. a valid XML
document.

    An object that encapsulates properties of a file type.  Note that unless otherwise stated, any
    method which returns a file_type also includes all inhereted valid_file_extensions and properties.
    
    file_type_id_ref id
        the unique string based id of this file type
        
    string name
        the human readable long name of the file type
    
    list<string> valid_file_extensions
        a list of extensions that are associated with this file type.  Note that in some cases this will
        include extensions that are inhereted from parent file types (e.g. a valid extension to a tab
        delimited file may be 'tab', but also 'txt' because it is a text file as well)
    
    mapping<string,string> properties
        a simple mapping of key/value pairs used to describe attributes of the file type.  These in general
        can have any string as a key, but note that the following keys have been adopted for most file
        types by convention.  Note that if these properties are not defined, then they are inherited from
        a parent file_type object
            default-extension  -  gives the single default extension
            default-web-renderer  -  the name/id of the widget that should be used by default to view the
                                     contents of this file type
